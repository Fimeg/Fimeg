    [PHILOSOPHY] Digital sovereignty over vendor lock-in. Your data, your infrastructure.
    [APPROACH] Transparency in methods, not just results. Teach the process.
    [REALITY] We ship bugs. We fix them. We log everything. Repeat.
    [ETHOS] Self-hosted infrastructure is a practice, not a product. Built for homelabs, not boardrooms.
